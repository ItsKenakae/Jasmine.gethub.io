<h1>How To Make Friends</h1>
<h2>Step 1: Break The Ice</h2>
<p> â€” The first step of all friendships is actually interacting with each other! Approach them and start a conversation. Many people accomplish this with an icebreaker, a casual question meant to dispell any awkwardness./p>
<p>Some common icebreakers include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hi, my name is [inset name], what's yours?</li>
    <li>How was your day today?</li>
    <li>The weather is nice right now, isn't it?</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Step 2: Find A Common Interest</h2>
<p>Once you've gotten past the introductory page, it's time to get more serious! Begin discussing your hobbies, interests, adn etc. Who knows, maybe you'll find some common ground!</p>
<h2>Step 3: Solidify Your Foundations</h2>
<p>Now that you're comfortable talking with each other and have found an interest or whatnot that you share, expand on it! For example, if you both like cats, then begin sending them cat videos on social media, or even invite them to your house if you have a cat! This is to build rapport and cement the budding feelings of friendship!</p>
<h2>Step 4: To A Long-Lasting Companionship!</h2>
<p>At this point, the two of you could probably be considered close acquaintances, if not friends already. To maintain and nurture that status, make sure to interact with them regularly. Keep talking to them, inviting them to hangouts, etc!</p>

<p>Making friends isn't as hard as it might seem. All you need to do is get out there and try your best and eventually, someone will reciprocate that effort. It's okay if you're shy or scared; that's natural. Friendship is a wonderful thing to have, and all people naturally seek it. This website sincerely hopes for your success in endeavors of friendship! Good Luck!</p>
<h2>Remember: Friendship is Magic!</h2>
