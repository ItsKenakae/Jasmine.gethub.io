<h2>Step 1: Break The Ice</h2>
<p> â€” The first step of all friendships is actually interacting with each other! Approach them and start a conversation. Many people accomplish this with an icebreaker, a casual question meant to dispell any awkwardness./p>
<p>Some common icebreakers include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hi, my name is [inset name], what's yours?</li>
    <li>How was your day today?</li>
    <li>The weather is nice right now, isn't it?</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Step 2: Find A Common Interest</h2>
<p>Once you've gotten past the introductory page, it's time to get more serious! Begin discussing your hobbies, interests, adn etc. Who knows, maybe you'll find some common ground!</p>
<h2>Step 3: Solidify Your Foundations</h2>
<p>Now that you're comfortable talking with each other and have found an interest or whatnot that you share, expand on it! For example, if you both like cats, then begin sending them cat videos on social media, or even invite them to your house if you have a cat! This is to build rapport and cement the budding feelings of friendship!</p>
